#AMANDA: Semi-supervised approach for learning on environments with gradual drift and extreme verification latency


You can test the framework for artificial datasets through a jupyter notebook in Datasets/benchmarking/sinthetic/BATCH_MODE

You can test the framework for real datasets through a jupyter notebook in Datasets/benchmarking/real/BATCH_MODE
